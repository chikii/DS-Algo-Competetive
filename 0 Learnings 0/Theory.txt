21. 2 Approaches: Reversing the linked list and then adding or Recursion. 
Gave both the solutions. Then the question was: In case of a billion digits, 
which would you prefer? Recursion has a lesser time complexity but, 
a normal system wonâ€™t be able to operate so much on recursion,
as there will be a stack overflow. Hence for a billion digits 
we have to go with reversing the linked list and then adding each digits.
