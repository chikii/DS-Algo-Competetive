38. Merge two sorted linked lists 
#DONE present in gfg

39. Given a list of N packing crates in the facility, any of which is a candidate to be moved to the new facility. 
The truck is initially at the origin of capacity M. Return the list of M locations closest to the truck.
#DONE sort according to distance and return first m points.

40. Given 2 strings a and b. a represent the first lane in which vehicles move from left to right. 
The b represents the second lane in which vehicles move from right to left. Vehicles can be B (bike), C (car), T (truck).
collision will occur only between two trucks. Find the probability of collision.
a = TCCBCTTB
b = BTCCBBTT
total number of collisions=7
Probability of collision = 7/36
sol -> Every vehical in lane will collide with its corresponding vehicle to comming vehical in another lane.
means 1st T in a will collide with all comming vehicle in b.
	T				 		 C
   	BTCCBBTT  => 8 = 8(total collide)		BTCCBBTT => 7 = 15(total collide)
simmilary with all vehical it give sum(n) = n(n+1)/2 => sum(8) - 36 (Total possible cases)

Favourable cases = when T will collide with correspending T and comming T in another lane. 3 + 2 + 2 = 7
probablity = 7/36
#DONE

41. Given a binary tree having unique values and an array arr of integers.
Return a list of root nodes of every component of the tree after deleting the nodes which are present in arr.
#DONE


42. Given a string and a pattern. Find the count of occurrences of pattern as sub sequence in the string(Non – overlapping).
43. Return the number of steps to reach from a node to another in a directed unweighted graph.
I did it using Level Order Traversal.

1. Given the stock prices of 10 days find the best possible buy sell pair.
6. cycle detection in a directed graph
7. Given an equation of the form X + Y =Z where one of X, Y, Z is missing, find the missing variable’s value. (2021)
8. Find the number of page faults given cache size ‘n’ and the page replacement algorithm is LRU.(2021)
9. Given a very large number ‘n’. Find the number of k digits with the second-highest frequency. (2021)
n=12341234567856785678 k=4     
Output:1234
10. Given various time slots, find the minimum number of blocks required to schedule deliveries. (2021)
Time slots: [1,3], [2,4], [16,20]
Output: 2 
11. (2021) Given a dictionary where the values are the connections of the key. 
Find if a person A can send a connection request to person B.
A person can only send a connection request if the number of connections between the two people is at most ‘k’.
Input: {1:[2,3,4], 4:[5,6],6:[7,8]} k=1 A=1 B=8
Output: NO 
sol- I initially decided to use the DFS approach but the interviewer pointed out that I don’t have to calculate the path,
only the number of nodes. So I applied BFS and kept track of the level.
If the level exceeded k before i found the node, I printed No else Yes.
12. Given a number ‘n’, construct all the possible structurally different binary trees(not BST) (2021)
17. Given a list of dependencies of a module, print the build order of that module.
Input: A-> B,C,D  | B-> C,F   |  C->E  Print build order of A
Output: E C F D B A  (Multiple correct answers were possible)
sol- DFS approach
45. Infix to Postfix conversion
46.  You are on the ground stair and you have to reach ‘Nth’ stair. At any stair, you can take at most ‘K’ steps. Find the total number of ways you can reach the Nth stair. int countWays(int N, int K)
