Greetings,

I am Yash Nandwal, lives in Indore. I am pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science, currently in final year. I have been an R&D intern in TCS and Quovantis Technologies, where I contributed to live projects.

I am a quick learner and open to learn in any direction. I like to do challenging task. My favourite topic is Data Structure, It is really wonderful, how with the help of structuring data, we can do magic in Time Complexity.

I would like to appear for an interview.

Thank and Regards
Yash Nandwal
