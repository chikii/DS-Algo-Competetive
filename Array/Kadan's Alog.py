# Q - subarray having maximum sum
"""
The simple idea of Kadaneâ€™s algorithm is to look for all positive contiguous segments of the array (max_ending_here is used for this).
And keep track of maximum sum contiguous segment among all positive segments (max_so_far is used for this). 
Each time we get a positive-sum compare it with max_so_far and update max_so_far if it is greater than max_so_far .
